(ASSIGNMENT AND COMMUNICATION)This ticket will first be handeled by the service agent that was created (John). Who will route the ticket to the appropriate place. As you can see from the image above the service agent John Doe updated the SLA plan as well as changed the help topic to more accurately fit the description.
